Hello Contentful team. 

My name is Philip and I’m a marketing student from Prasetiya Mulya—one of the best business school in Indonesia. While attending lectures there, I soon realized that I loved design, especially all things about branding.

After the class, I envisioned to build my own agency, so I started practicing design regularly. Soon—I won trusts from several parties. I’ve built identity for mini-market, restaurant, and student enrichment program. All could be accessed from [https://behance.net/philipyoungg](https://behance.net/philipyoungg)

After designing for several years, I discovered that I enjoy designing, not because of “design” per se—but because it changes user perception and or how they feels. That realization made me understand what I’m passionate about: making utility tools (i.e. todo list, alarm clock). It is simple—but those simple things can change their behavior and make a better version of themselves.

To build one, I learn how to code in 2016. It’s been a success and I’ve made several products. One of them is on [typography.philipyoungg.com](typography.philipyoungg.com) (desktop and iPad only). It’s not finished yet—but I’m improving it on my spare time.  

I love building products, and that’s the reason I’m choosing Contentful.

Contentul solve "database" problem. Previously, it took so much time for developer to build schema, scaling it, etc. Contentful help startups, business by simplifying it so they could move faster.

Another reason: I want to challenge myself by working overseas and exchange ideas with talented teams. Contentul have both of them!

I've been holding back to apply from last year because I believe I can't provide enough value at that time...

...but it’s different now. I learned tons about front-end, back-end, product designs, growth-hacking, and collecting users feedback while working at [https://www.bukapintu.co](https://www.bukapintu.co).

Based on that reason, I feel ready and now applying for Product Design position.
