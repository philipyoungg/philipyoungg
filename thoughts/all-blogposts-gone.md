My blog posts from last 3 years are all gone. The hosting provider told that they didn't kept any backup (lesson learned: backup). Meanwhile, I tried to manually add posts that saved on my local computer.

Keeping on positive note, I always wanted to redesign this website—and this event helps me to keep this on top priority.

Everything should be finished before 2017. 

Let's hope for the best! 😁
